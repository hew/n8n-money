## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### What It Does
1. **Receives Claims** via webhook (web form, email, API)
2. **AI Processing** extracts key information from claim data
3. **Fraud Detection** scores claims 1-10 for suspicious patterns
4. **Smart Routing** sends high-risk claims to senior adjusters
5. **Customer Communication** sends instant status updates
6. **Task Management** creates appropriate staff assignments

### Workflow Paths
- **Auto Claims** (< $10K): Standard 3-5 day processing
- **High-Value Claims** (> $10K): Senior adjuster review within 24h
- **Fraud Suspected**: Immediate investigation priority
- **Property Claims**: Specialist assignment with contractor verification

## 🎬 Demo Script

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
> "I'm going to show you how we can reduce your claims processing from 3 hours to 3 minutes. Watch this..."

### Live Demo (2 minutes)
1. **Submit a claim** via webhook
2. **Watch AI processing** in real-time
3. **Show results**: Customer emails, staff tasks, fraud scores

### ROI Discussion (3 minutes)
- Calculate their specific savings
- Show fraud detection benefits
- Discuss scalability without hiring

## 📊 Test Scenarios

Run `./test-claims.sh` to see:

1. **Standard Claim** ($3,200) → Approved automatically
2. **High-Value Claim** ($15,750) → Senior review required  
3. **Suspicious Claim** → Fraud investigation triggered
4. **Property Claim** → Specialist assignment

## 🛠️ Customization Options
